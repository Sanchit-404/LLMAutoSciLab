You are working with a damped harmonic oscillator system. The setup consists of a mass attached to a spring and subject to a damping force. You can control the physical properties of the system and observe how the amplitude of oscillation evolves over time.

**Experimental Setup:**
1. **Spring-Mass System:**
    - A mass m is attached to a spring, forming a classic harmonic oscillator.
2. **Damping Medium:**
    - The system is immersed in a fluid that exerts a damping force proportional to the velocity of the mass.
3. **Initial Conditions:**
    - The system is displaced with an initial amplitude A₀ and then released to oscillate freely.
4. **Measurement:**
    - The apparatus records the amplitude of oscillation over time. Data is collected over two periods, with a maximum of 20 time-amplitude points per experiment.

**Control Parameters:**
- `k_constant`: k
- `mass`: m
- `b_constant`: b
- `initial_amplitude`: A0

# Code assisted specific instructions for interactive Python code execution
CODE_ASSISTED_PROMPT_INSTRUCTION = """**IMPORTANT: You have access to interactive Python code execution through <python> tags.**

**How to use <python> tags:**
1. **You can write ANY Python code** - functions, calculations, print statements, etc.
2. **Format:** <python>your_python_code_here</python>
3. **You can submit multiple <python> tags** to test different ideas
4. **Each <python> tag will be executed** and you'll get immediate feedback in <python_output> tags
5. **Use the feedback** to refine your understanding and calculations

**CRITICAL: Use EXACTLY these tags:**
- Start with: `<python>`
- End with: `</python>`
- NOT `<|python_tag|>` or any other variation

**Examples:**

**Complex calculation:**
```
<python>
import math
from scipy.integrate import quad

# Example involving logarithms and exponentials
x = 2.5
log_val = math.log(x)
exp_val = math.exp(x)
result = log_val * exp_val
print(f"ln({x}) * e^{x} = {result}")

# Example involving definite integrals
def f(x):
    return math.exp(-x**2)

# Integrate from 0 to 1
result, error = quad(f, 0, 1)

print("Integral result:", result)
print("Estimated error:", error)
</python>
```

**Function definition and testing:**
```
<python>
def test_hypothesis(k, m, b):
    import math
    try:
        return math.sqrt(k/m - (b/(2*m))**2)
    except ValueError:
        return float('nan')

# Test with different parameters
print(test_hypothesis(10.0, 1.0, 0.5))
</python>
```

**System Response:**
```
<python_output>
✅ **Python Code Execution Successful!**

**Output:**
3.122498999199199

**Your Code:**
```python
def test_hypothesis(k, m, b):
    import math
    try:
        return math.sqrt(k/m - (b/(2*m))**2)
    except ValueError:
        return float('nan')

# Test with different parameters
print(test_hypothesis(10.0, 1.0, 0.5))
```
</python_output>
```

**Workflow:**
1. **Analyze the problem** and form initial hypotheses
2. **Use <python> tags** to test your ideas, perform calculations, or explore data
3. **Analyze the results** from <python_output> and refine your understanding
4. **Repeat** with more <python> tags until you're confident in your solution
5. **Submit final law** using <final_law> tags with proper Python function format"""
