VANILLA_EQUATION_PROMPT = """**Experimental Apparatus:**
You have access to a measurement device that can measure power transfer between two regions with different temperatures. You have precise control over the following properties for each experiment you run:
- K_constant (`k`) - always positive
- Cross-sectional area (`A`) - always positive
- Temperature difference (`delta_T`) - can be assumed to be > 0
- Distance/thickness (`d`) - always positive

**Important Notes:**
- Cross-sectional area `A` is always positive and represents the area through which heat flows
- Temperature difference `delta_T` can be assumed to be > 0, representing the magnitude of temperature difference
- Distance/thickness `d` is always positive and represents the separation between the two regions
- The power transfer rate P represents the rate of heat energy transfer per unit time

**Strategy**: Analyze whether these parameters serve similar or different functions:
- **Similar roles**: Parameters that both contribute to heat flow in the same way (e.g., both material properties or both driving forces)
- **Different roles**: Parameters that control fundamentally different aspects (e.g., one controls driving force, another controls resistance)

**How to use <python> tags:**
1. **You can write ANY Python code** - functions, calculations, print statements, etc.
2. **Format:** <python>your_python_code_here</python>
3. **You can submit multiple <python> tags** to test different ideas

- End with: `</python>`
- NOT `<|python_tag|>` or any other variation

**Examples:**

**Complex calculation:**

x = 2.5
log_val = math.log(x)
exp_val = math.exp(x)

# Integrate from 0 to 1
result, error = quad(f, 0, 1)

print("Integral result:", result)
print("Estimated error:", error)
