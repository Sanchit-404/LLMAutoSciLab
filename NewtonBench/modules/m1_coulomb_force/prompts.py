You have access to a device that can position two point charges and measure the force acting between them. You have precise control over the following properties for each experiment you run:
- Charge of the first object (`q1`) - should be a positive real number
- Charge of the second object (`q2`) - should be a positive real number  
- Distance between the charges (`distance`) - always positive

**Important Notes:**
- Charges `q1` and `q2` are always positive
- Distance `distance` is always positive and represents the magnitude of separation
- No need to use abs() on distance since it's guaranteed to be positive

COULOMB_1D_DISCOVERY_PROMPT = """**Experimental Apparatus:**

You have access to a 1D motion tracking system that can:
1. Position two charges (q1, q2) at any 1D coordinates
2. Both charges decay exponentially over time with a fixed decay rate: q(t) = q(0) * exp(-t/decay_rate)
3. Decay rate will not be disclosed to you
4. Track the electric field at each charge over time

**Control Parameters:**
- `q1`: Initial charge of the fixed object at origin (can be positive or negative)
- `m1`: Mass of q1 (use np.inf to ensure it's fixed)
- `q2`: Initial charge of the moving object (can be positive or negative)
- `m2`: Mass of q2 (affects acceleration via F=ma)
- `distance`: Initial distance between charges (always positive)
- `duration`: Time to track motion
- `time_step`: Time interval between measurements

**Important Notes:**
- Charges `q1` and `q2` can be negative (electrons) or positive (protons)
- The sign of `q1` and `q2` are critical. Their product determines whether the force will be repulsive (positive) or attractive (negative). Therefore, do not use abs() on your final law.
- Distance `distance` is always positive and represents the initial separation
- Masses `m1` and `m2` affect the acceleration via F=ma
- The system provides time and velocity data over time

# Code assisted specific instructions for interactive Python code execution
CODE_ASSISTED_PROMPT_INSTRUCTION = """**IMPORTANT: You have access to interactive Python code execution through <python> tags.**

**How to use <python> tags:**
1. **You can write ANY Python code** - functions, calculations, print statements, etc.
2. **Format:** <python>your_python_code_here</python>
3. **You can submit multiple <python> tags** to test different ideas
4. **Each <python> tag will be executed** and you'll get immediate feedback in <python_output> tags
5. **Use the feedback** to refine your understanding and calculations

**CRITICAL: Use EXACTLY these tags:**
- Start with: `<python>`
- End with: `</python>`
- NOT `<|python_tag|>` or any other variation

**Examples:**

**Complex calculation:**
```
<python>
import math
from scipy.integrate import quad

# Example involving logarithms and exponentials
x = 2.5
log_val = math.log(x)
exp_val = math.exp(x)
result = log_val * exp_val
print(f"ln({x}) * e^{x} = {result}")

# Example involving definite integrals
def f(x):
	return math.exp(-x**2)

# Integrate from 0 to 1
result, error = quad(f, 0, 1)

print("Integral result:", result)
print("Estimated error:", error)
</python>
```

**Function definition and testing:**
```
<python>
def test_hypothesis(q1, q2, distance):
	C = 2.0
	return (C * q1 * q2) / (distance ** 3)

# Test with different parameters
test_q1 = [1.0, -1.0, 2.0]
test_q2 = [1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
test_distance = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

for q1_val, q2_val, d_val in zip(test_q1, test_q2, test_distance):
	force = test_hypothesis(q1_val, q2_val, d_val)
	print(f"q1={q1_val}, q2={q2_val}, d={d_val} → F={force}")
</python>
```

**System Response:**
```
<python_output>
✅ **Python Code Execution Successful!**

**Output:**
q1=1.0, q2=1.0, d=1.0 → F=2.0
q1=-1.0, q2=1.0, d=2.0 → F=-0.25
q1=2.0, q2=-1.0, d=3.0 → F=-0.0741

**Your Code:**
```python
def test_hypothesis(q1, q2, distance):
	C = 2.0
	return (C * q1 * q2) / (distance ** 3)

# Test with different parameters
test_q1 = [1.0, -1.0, 2.0]
test_q2 = [1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
test_distance = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

	print(f"q1={q1_val}, q2={q2_val}, d={d_val} → F={force}")

```

**Workflow:**
1. **Analyze the problem** and form initial hypotheses
2. **Use <python> tags** to test your ideas, perform calculations, or explore data
3. **Analyze the results** from <python_output> and refine your understanding
4. **Repeat** with more <python> tags until you're confident in your solution
5. **Submit final law** using <final_law> tags with proper Python function format"""
